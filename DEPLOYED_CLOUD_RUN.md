# üéâ Your MCP Server is LIVE on Google Cloud Run!

## Deployment Success!

Your SF Parking MCP server is now running at:

**https://sf-parking-mcp-586287909845.us-central1.run.app**

## Use with Claude Desktop

Add this to your Claude Desktop config:

**MacOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
**Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sf-parking-cloud": {
      "url": "https://sf-parking-mcp-586287909845.us-central1.run.app/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

**Restart Claude Desktop** and you'll see your 3 parking tools available!

## Test It

Ask Claude:
- "What's the parking situation near Union Square in SF?"
- "Find parking on Market Street"
- "Show me parking rates downtown San Francisco"

Claude will call YOUR hosted MCP server and get real parking data!
