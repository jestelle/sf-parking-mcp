# MCP Hosting Reality Check

## The Problem

MCP servers use **persistent connections** (stdio or SSE), but free serverless platforms like Vercel use **short-lived request/response functions**. They're fundamentally incompatible.

## Your Real Options

### Option 1: Run Locally (EASIEST - What I Built)
**Cost: FREE | Setup: 2 minutes**

```bash
uv run server.py
```

Configure Claude Desktop:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sf-parking": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["--directory", "/Users/joshestelle/tools/sf-parking", "run", "server.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Pros:**
- Works perfectly out of the box
- No configuration needed
- Fast - no network latency

**Cons:**
- Only works on your machine
- Need to run when using Claude

### Option 2: Publish to PyPI (For Distribution)
**Cost: FREE | Setup: 10 minutes**

Others can install with `pip install sf-parking-mcp` and run locally on their machines.

**Pros:**
- Easy for others to install
- Professional distribution
- Still free

**Cons:**
- Each user runs their own copy
- Not truly "hosted"

### Option 3: Real Hosting with Persistent Connections
**Cost: ~$5-10/month | Setup: 30-60 minutes**

Options:
- **Railway.app** - $5/month, supports long-running processes
- **Fly.io** - ~$5/month free tier, then pay-as-you-go
- **DigitalOcean** - $4/month droplet
- **AWS EC2 t4g.nano** - ~$3/month

You'd need to:
1. Package as a Docker container
2. Deploy to a platform with persistent connections
3. Configure SSL/HTTPS
4. Handle authentication
5. Keep it running 24/7

**Pros:**
- Actually hosted
- Anyone can connect

**Cons:**
- Costs money
- More complex setup
- Need to maintain a server

### Option 4: Convert to REST API (Different Architecture)
**Cost: FREE on Vercel | Setup: A few hours of work**

Ditch the MCP protocol entirely and create a simple REST API that Claude can call via web fetch.

**Pros:**
- Works on serverless
- Truly free

**Cons:**
- Not an MCP server anymore
- Would need to rewrite the code
- Claude would use it differently (web fetch, not MCP tools)

## My Recommendation

**Use Option 1 (local)** - it's what MCP was designed for! The server I built works perfectly for this.

If you want others to use it: **Option 2 (PyPI)** - we already set up GitHub for this.

If you truly need hosted and are willing to pay: **Option 3** - but honestly, for a parking API, local is fine.

## What We Have Now

- ✓ Working local MCP server
- ✓ GitHub repository
- ✗ Vercel deployment (incompatible architecture)

The Vercel deployment won't work without major changes to either:
- The MCP protocol (not possible)
- The hosting platform (needs persistent connections)
- The architecture (convert to REST API, no longer MCP)

Sorry for the confusion earlier - I should have clarified this from the start!
