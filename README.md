# SF Parking API

A REST API that provides access to San Francisco parking data via the SFMTA ArcGIS REST API.

**ðŸŽ‰ Live API:** https://sf-parking.vercel.app/api

## Features

This server exposes three tools for querying SF parking blockface data:

- **get_parking_by_bbox**: Query parking data within a bounding box (lat/lon coordinates)
- **get_parking_by_street**: Search for parking by street name
- **get_parking_by_location**: Find parking near a specific point

Data includes street parking availability, rates, schedules, and location information for all SF parking zones.

## Installation

### Option 1: Using uv (Recommended)

```bash
# Install uv if you haven't already
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Clone or download this repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd sf-parking

# Install dependencies
uv sync
```

### Option 2: Using pip

```bash
pip install -e .
```

### Option 3: Install from PyPI (after publishing)

```bash
pip install sf-parking-mcp
```

## Usage

### With Claude Desktop

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sf-parking": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/sf-parking",
